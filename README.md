## üöÄ Key Features

* üñ•Ô∏è **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks live CPU (overall and per-core), memory, and disk usage statistics.
* üö® **Intelligent Alerting:** Triggers alerts based on configurable CPU, memory, and disk thresholds with severity levels.
* üìä **Data Persistence:** Saves alert and performance history to JSON files for auditing and tracking.
* üìù **Comprehensive Logging:** Maintains a timestamped `system-monitor.log` file for all major events and errors.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a clean separation of concerns for services, display, and utilities.
* üé® **User-Friendly CLI:** Features a color-coded interface and multiple commands for easy interaction.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project uses a modular architecture to ensure code is scalable and easy to maintain.

* `src/cli`: Handles command-line argument parsing and command execution.
* `src/config`: Manages application configuration, including alert thresholds.
* `src/display`: Responsible for rendering all CLI output, including the main dashboard.
* `src/services`: Contains the core business logic for monitoring, alerting, and file I/O.
* `src/utils`: Provides helper functions for formatting data and system interactions.
* `index.js`: The main entry point for the application.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Core:** Node.js (ES Modules)
* **CLI UI:** `chalk` for color-coded output.
* **APIs:** Node.js `os` and `fs` modules for system interaction and file I/O.

    ```

* **View other options:**
    ```bash
    # Show all available commands
    node index.js --help

    # View recent system alerts
    node index.js --alerts

    # View historical performance data
    node index.js --history

    # Display current configuration
    node index.js --config

    # Clear all logged alerts and history
    node index.js --clear
    ```

## üí° Advanced Highlight: CPU Calculation

To ensure accuracy, CPU usage is not just read instantaneously. It's calculated by comparing system tick snapshots over an interval, providing a true measure of usage during that time.

```javascript
// Calculates actual CPU usage between two snapshots
function calculateCPU(oldCpu, newCpu) {
    const oldTotal = Object.values(oldCpu.times).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    const newTotal = Object.values(newCpu.times).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

    const totalDiff = newTotal - oldTotal;
    const idleDiff = newCpu.times.idle - oldCpu.times.idle;
    const activeTime = totalDiff - idleDiff;

    return ((100 * activeTime) / totalDiff);
}
